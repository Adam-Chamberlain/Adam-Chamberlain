## Hi there!

I'm Adam Chamberlain, a recent college graduate and aspiring data analyst! I have spent the last 6+ months teaching myself everything I need to know to be a successful data analyst, including:
• Advanced Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets, including Pivot Tables, advanced formulas (VLOOKUP, COUNTIFS, IF, etc), and building/designing charts. I received a Microsoft Excel certification in April 2024.
• Intermediate SQL knowledge, including temporary tables and joining tables with JOIN
• Basic R knowledge
• Basic Tableau knowledge
