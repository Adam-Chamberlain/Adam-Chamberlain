## Projects

**[ðŸš² Cyclistic Case Study](https://github.com/Adam-Chamberlain/Cyclistic-Case-Study)**

This case identifies how casual users of a bike-share company use bikes differently than annual members and how they could be converted to members. I used Microsoft Excel and SQL to clean, analyze, and visualize 5.6 million rows of data spanning from 12 months.
  
**[ðŸŽ® Pokemon Teambuilding Helper](https://github.com/Adam-Chamberlain/Pokemon-Teambuilding-Helper)**

This resource I created as a hobby helps competitive Pokemon battlers easily visualize key information in a given matchup to improve their competitive performance. I used advanced Google Sheets to make it as automated and user-friendly as possible, and hundreds of people currently use the resource on a weekly basis.
