## Hi there!

I'm Adam Chamberlain, a recent college graduate and aspiring Data Analyst! I graduated from Southwestern University with a Bachelor of Arts in Business in May 2023, and since then, I have taken many online courses and achieved certifications to continue learning and improving upon my data analytics skills. This is my portfolio full of projects that I have completed to strengthen and build upon my knowledge and showcase my thought process in solving complex problems. I am always pursuing new projects, so this portfolio will be frequently updated!

I am actively looking for a long-term career where I can utilize my strong critical thinking, problem solving, and analytical skills to add value to the organization while I continue to learn and develop relevant new skills. I pride myself on being an incredibly fast learner, and I am not afraid to challenge myself to solve complex problems.

## Technical Skills
- Advanced Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets, including Pivot Tables, advanced functions (VLOOKUP, COUNTIFS, IF, etc), Conditional Formatting / Data Validation, and building / designing charts. I received a Microsoft Excel certification in April 2024.
- Intermediate SQL knowledge, including temporary tables and CTEs, joining tables with JOIN, and subqueries
- Basic R / R Markdown knowledge
- Basic Tableau knowledge
- Basic / Intermediate Adobe Photoshop experience

## Projects

**[ðŸ“ˆ 8 Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/Adam-Chamberlain/8-Week-SQL-Challenge)**

This is a set of eight different case studies that require SQL to find important datapoints and solve complex questions. So far, I have completed the first three using complex SQL queries, which include CTEs, subqueries, CASE statements, and much more.

**[ðŸš² Cyclistic Case Study](https://github.com/Adam-Chamberlain/Cyclistic-Case-Study)**

This case study identifies how casual users of a bike-share company use bikes differently than annual members and how they could potentially be converted to members. I used Microsoft Excel and SQL to clean, analyze, and visualize 5.6 million rows of data spanning from 12 months.
  
**[ðŸŽ® Pokemon Teambuilding Helper](https://github.com/Adam-Chamberlain/Pokemon-Teambuilding-Helper)**

I created this resource for fun to help competitive Pokemon battlers easily visualize key information in a given match to improve their own competitive performance. I used advanced Google Sheets functions and tactics to make it as automated and user-friendly as possible, and hundreds of people currently use it on a weekly basis.
